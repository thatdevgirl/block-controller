Turn on and off specific post editor content blocks.

== Description ==

This WordPress plugin provides site administrators with the ability to turn on and off specific post editor (Gutenberg) content blocks.

== Installation ==

1. In the WordPress admin, install and activate the ThreePM Block Controller plugin.

2. Go to the plugin's settings page under `Settings -> Block Controller`. _(Only administrators have access to this page.)_

3. All blocks are on (enabled) by default to prevent compatibility issues on plugin activation.

4. Turn off any block that you would like to disable.

5. Some blocks will not be able to be disabled because they are already used by at least one post or page on the site. You can only disable blocks that are not currently in use. If a block is in use by at least one post, the number of uses will be listed next to that block, along with a link to a list of what posts contain that block.
